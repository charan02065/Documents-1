Git merge is a command in the Git version control system that integrates changes from one branch into another. 
When you have multiple branches in a Git repository and want to combine the changes made in one branch into another, you can use the git merge command.

For instance, let's say you have a feature branch where you've been working on a new feature, and now you want to bring those changes into your main branch. 
You'd switch to the main branch and use git merge along with the name of the feature branch to merge the changes.

In the process of merging we have face some issuse like conflicting changes.then Git will prompt you to resolve these conflicts manually

# Start in the main branch
git checkout main

# Merge changes from the feature branch into main
git merge feature-branch
